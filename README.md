I made mods only to the image classification program so far, just to get it to work in ubuntu 18.04,
and with Anaconda python 3.x installed.

I tried out all the models that were available, plus added a test with the wohlert squeezenet model.
Everything worked, except for the densenet models.  I didn't try to debug those further.  I left the 
configurations for the other models in comments.  The current one is the SqueezeNet model.
